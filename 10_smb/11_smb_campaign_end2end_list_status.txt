Documentation 			Steps for SMB End to End Test
...						1. Create an advertiser 
...						2. Create a campaign mapped to the advertiser created with or without creative (current date 7.8)
...						3. Create a creative 
...						4. Manually approve the creative in QA and attach it to the campaign by updating the campaign creative.
...						5. Edit the smb_list_status in the database manually to update the status to 1
...						6. Create another creative and approve it
...						7. Attach the new creative to the campaign
...						8. Check to ensure that the campaign status is set to LIVE when everything is set correctly
...						9. Since we do not have list attachments for qa, we do not validate the ads serving.
